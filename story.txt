Once upon a time, there was a person named John Jacobs Jacobsen Johannesburg. People called him Jquad. He was goinf through his 
day when he realized he had to pick his grandmother up from the airport. But he was too late now. He saw his grandmother coming 
home in a taxi. He was scolded for about two hours for this incident and his grandmother was very upset, but they eventually had
a nice dinner together.

However, John was shocked to find out his grandmother had been at the head of an international robbery scheme. John had no idea what to think. He now 
understood why his grandmother was so angry about getting picked up, because she was on the most wanted list. John called his grandmother to find out the truth.

His grandmother, sneaky as she was, denied everything. In fact, not only did she lie, but to get the FBI off her trail she deposited all the stolen
jewels in John's kitchen cupboard. Specifically, in between the basil and the cooking wine. John had not yet realized this by the time the FBI
was knocking on his door

Suddenly, his grandmother disappeared. After a second, the knocking was gone. John opened the door, and saw that FBIs were dead
with blood on his grandmother hands. The grandmother committed that she is actually a super killer and is proficient at nearly all
killing methods in the world.

John's grandmother leaves John's house with a mysterious smile and says that she would make sure that there would be no peace in 
frooplyland (john's country) anymore. John was so shocked that he picked up the gun and shot his grandmother in the back. And then he woke 
up, realising he overslept and is now running late to pick up his grandmother from the airport.
